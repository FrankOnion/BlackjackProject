# Blackjack Command Line Game

## Project Description

Simple implementation of the classic card game Blackjack. In this game, players are dealt two cards each, and they aim to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over. The game follows standard Blackjack rules, including card values and the "rule of 17" for the dealer.

## How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. You will be dealt two cards face-up, while the dealer will have one card face-up and one card face-down.
3. The program will ask if you want to "HIT" (add another card to your hand) or "STAND" (keep your current hand).
4. Continue choosing "HIT" or "STAND" until you decide to "STAND" or your hand's total value exceeds 21.
5. Once you "STAND," the dealer will reveal their face-down card and follow the "rule of 17" (hit if their hand is below 17).
6. The game will determine the winner based on the total values of the player's and dealer's hands.

## Technologies Used

- Java programming language
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- Console input and output for user interaction

## Lessons Learned

This project helped reinforce several key programming concepts, including:

- Building classes in an Object-Oriented manner.
- Writing methods to implement game logic.
- Using collections to organize and manage data (e.g., cards in a deck, cards in a hand).
- Implementing conditionals to create game logic (e.g., determining when to hit or stand).
- Handling user input and displaying game state through console output.

## Future Improvements

While the current implementation covers the basic functionality of Blackjack, there is room for further enhancements and improvements:

- Adding more advanced Blackjack rules, such as "soft" Aces and "Blackjack" hands.
- Implementing input validation to handle user input errors gracefully.
- Extending the game to allow multiple rounds or continuous play.
- Refactoring code for better organization and readability.
- Incorporating additional features like betting or tracking player statistics.
